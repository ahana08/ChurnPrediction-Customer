Each row represents a customer, and each column contains the customer’s attributes described in the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month—the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information: how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic information about customers: gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.
